## Hi 🌸

I'm Zosia, a Master's student in Data Science at the Silesian University of Technology.  
I have a background in Automation and Robotics, and I'm passionate about using data and deep learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.

- 🐜 I’m currently learning about evolutionary strategies, deep learning, and advanced data analysis techniques.
- 🦋 Always curious about AI, intelligent systems, and how modern technology can be used creatively.
